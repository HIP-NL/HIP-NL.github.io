The Historical Income Panel for the Netherlands project (HIP-NL) is creating a unique large-scale historical income panel. Using municipal tax records income estimates at 10-year intervals will be gathered for c. 200,000 individuals in the Netherlands between 1851 and 1922. Recent mass digitisation of vital records and population registers, as well as the development of data integration tools means we will be able to connect the income panel to many other important economic and social history datasets, and answer questions about social and economic inequality over a long time frame, across multiple dimensions, and over multiple generations.
