Population registers are crucial for identifying the taxed individuals in our project. We rely heavily on volunteer ❤️ transcriptions, such as those hosted by 
[archieven.nl](https://www.archieven.nl/nl/zoeken?mivast=0&mizig=310&miadt=0&miview=tbl&milang=nl&mif2=112). However, these registers don't always provide the necessary information for efficient identification. For example, knowing the time period a register covers is vital, but source notes can lack this information. Similarly, archives sometimes combine registers from multiple municipalities, making it difficult to distinguish between them.

To address these challenges, we've turned to "data digging." In this instance, we plotted the proportion of individuals within each source who were born in Enschede or Lonneker. By visualizing these sources in the "Enschede-Lonneker space," we get a clear separation.
